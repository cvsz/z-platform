# Wiki Schema

## Page Types

| Type | Directory | Purpose |
|------|-----------|---------|
| entity | wiki/entities/ | Named things (models, companies, people, datasets) |
| concept | wiki/concepts/ | Ideas, techniques, phenomena |
| source | wiki/sources/ | Papers, articles, talks, blog posts |
| query | wiki/queries/ | Open questions under investigation |
| comparison | wiki/comparisons/ | Side-by-side analysis of related entities |
| synthesis | wiki/synthesis/ | Cross-cutting summaries and conclusions |

## Naming Conventions

- Files: `kebab-case.md`
- Entities: match official name where possible (e.g., `gpt-4.md`, `openai.md`)
- Concepts: descriptive noun phrases (e.g., `chain-of-thought.md`)
- Sources: `author-year-slug.md` (e.g., `wei-2022-chain-of-thought.md`)
- Queries: question as slug (e.g., `does-scale-improve-reasoning.md`)

## Frontmatter

All pages must include YAML frontmatter:
